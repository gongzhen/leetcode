 Similarly, the keyword__contravariant enables us to cast
 Queue<Sup *> to Queue<Sub *> . However, it is not permitted
 to use both __contravariant and __covariant at the same for
 type declaration.
 In conclusion, __covariant is to indicate that subtypes
 are acceptable, and __contravariant to indicate that
 supertypes are acceptable. This can be seen in many cases
 such as the interface of NSArray.
